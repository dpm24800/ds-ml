# Git Basics
- **Repository**: A repository (or repo) is a collection of files and directories that you want to track with Git. It can be a local repository on your computer or a remote repository on a server.
- **Commit**: A commit is a snapshot of your repository at a given point in time. When you make changes to your code, you can create a new commit to save those changes. Each commit has a unique identifier called a hash.
- **Branch**: A branch is a separate line of development in your Git repository. You can create a new branch to work on a new feature or bugfix without affecting the main codebase. When you're done, you can merge your changes back into the main branch.
- **Merging**: Merging is the process of combining changes from one branch into another. When you merge a branch, Git automatically reconciles any conflicts between the two sets of changes.
- **Pulling**: Pulling is the process of downloading changes from a remote repository and merging them into your local repository. You typically pull changes from a remote before pushing your own changes to avoid conflicts.
- **Pushing**: Pushing is the process of uploading your changes to a remote repository. When you push your changes, they become visible to others who have access to the remote repository.
- **Tag**: A tag is a way to mark a specific commit with a label. Tags are often used to mark release points in your codebase, so you can easily refer back to a specific version of your code.
- **Pull Request (PR)**: A pull request (PR) is a way to propose changes to a Git repository. When you create a pull request, you're asking the repository owner to review and merge your changes.
- **Staging Area/Index**: The staging area (also known as the index) is an intermediate step between modifying your files and committing your changes. You can use the staging area to review your changes and decide which changes you want to include in your next commit.
- **Forking**: Forking is the process of creating a new copy of a Git repository on your own account. You can make changes to your forked repository without affecting the original repository, and you can create a pull request to propose your changes be merged back into the original repository.
- **Gitignore file**: A Gitignore file is a special file that tells Git which files or directories to ignore when tracking changes in your repository. You can use Gitignore to exclude files like compiled binaries or sensitive configuration files from being committed to the repository.
- **Rebasing**: Rebasing is a way to integrate changes from one branch into another. When you rebase a branch, you move the changes from the source branch onto the tip of the target branch, so it appears that the changes were made directly on the target branch.
- **Cherry-picking**: Cherry-picking is a way to apply a specific commit from one branch to another. When you cherry-pick a commit, you're essentially copying the changes made in that commit and applying them to another branch.
